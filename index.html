    <h3>Java Game Project 2022</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2nd semester of Java at 
	City (2022). This Java project was very enjoyable to create and spend time as I felt as if i have learnt a lot. I faced some tribulations through out but worked hard to overcome them.
    The game is a simple platformer where to progress through the levels you must collect all 3 souls per level to use the statue to transportto the next level. There are enemies throughout the level who will make you lose a life if you touch them. There are simple controls using the arrows and spacebar to move.
